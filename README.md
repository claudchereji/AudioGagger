Get gagged... voluntarily


## Google Speech-to-text
This speech to text model uses Googles speech to text api which means... you guessed it! you will need a google cloud bucket for it to work.
until I can find a way to spin up a cloud instance or get whisper working to work on your local machine, this is what it is. 

## But does it even work?
YES! check out the example audio and the result audio to see whats up. currently, I'm suffering from a syncing issue where the overlayed sound effect doesn't line up with every cussword and i feel like thats a google problem. i feel like the time accuracy is not as great as I hoped. it could also be a problem with my code which is the best possibility.

## Will there be updates to the code? 
you bet your a$$ there will!
